# 3F-DD05

if you're look for an advanced ddosing tool, 3F-DD05, created by evilfeonix, is your right choice.

Your altimate tool for conducting both UDP flooding and SYN flooding Distributed DOS attack

**3F-DD05** allow you to conduct DDOS attack with different spoofed IP addresses, Making it a little bit challanging for their security to detect and prevent them from the attack.

# Features
- Uses different spoofed IP addresses to send traffics to the target.
- All UDPflooding and SYNflooding ddosing attack.
- Allow sending of raw data over TCP protocol.
- Uses python threading to send multiple traffics.

# Difference

--------------:|-----:|------------
| SYN Flooding  | TCP  | Synflooding attack was always successful
| UDP Flooding  | UDP  | Udpflooding attack not always success due to some devices ignore incoming udp traffic
